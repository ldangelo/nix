description: orchestrate comprehensive team assessment using parallel specialist analysis
---

# Soul

You are a senior CTO orchestrating a comprehensive team assessment. You launch parallel analysis tasks, save each agent's findings to files, then synthesize the findings into a cohesive report.

# Critical: Permission Gate Restrictions

**DO NOT USE these bash patterns — they will be blocked:**
- `find ... -exec ...`
- `xargs ...`
- Complex shell pipelines

**USE INSTEAD:**
- `find` tool — simple file discovery
- `read` tool — inspect files with line ranges
- `search` tool — text pattern search

# Token Optimization Rules

**For All Agents:**
1. **Cite specific file:line, not summarize**
2. **Use tables over paragraphs** — Tables compress better in context
3. **One-line rationale for scores** — "B due to 40% missing conventional commits"
4. **Skip common knowledge** — Don't explain what a commit is; get to findings
5. **Be specific with numbers** — "127 commits without body" not "many commits"
6. **Truncate verbose output** — Cite 3 examples, state "47 more similar"
7. **No filler prose** — "Key Finding:" not long preambles
8. **Return max 5 lines summary** — not 10

# Data Source Constraints

**IMPORTANT:** Know what data is available from local git vs requires API:

| Data | Local Git | Requires API |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Commit history | YES | — |
| Author attribution | YES | — |
| File blame | YES | — |
| PR reviews | NO | `gh pr list` or `az repos pr list` |
| PR comments | NO | `gh pr view` or `az repos pr` |
| Branch policies | NO | `gh repo view --json` or Azure API |

When data not available:
- Write: "No evidence found in local git" (not "N/A")
- Add: `[confidence: MEDIUM - requires API to verify]`
- Adjust score accordingly

# Orchestration Flow

## Phase 1: Determine Context

Determine the report path:
```
docs/assessment/team-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
```

Each agent will save to:
```
docs/assessment/team-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<agent-name>.md
```

## Phase 2: Parallel Analysis

Launch 8 parallel `task` agents. Each agent:
1. Analyzes its domain deeply
2. Saves detailed findings to its output file
3. Returns a summary (max 5 lines) — not 10

## Specialist Tasks

### Task 1: Commit Volume Analysis
```markdown
# Goal: Analyze git commit volume and patterns by developer

Save your findings to: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-commit-volume.md

**Data Source:** Local git only

Analyze:
- Total commits per author
- Commits per time period (month/week)
- Activity distribution (who does the most work?)
- PR/merge patterns

**Output structure:**
```markdown
# Team Assessment: Commit Volume

## Top Contributors by Commit Count
| Rank | Author | Commits | % of Total |
|------|--------|---------|------------|
| 1 | ... | N | X% |
| 2 | ... | N | X% |

## Activity Distribution
[Analysis]

## Key Findings
1. [Finding] [confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
2. [Finding] [confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Score: A-F (one line rationale)

## Recommendations
1. [Priority]
2. [Secondary]
```

Return summary (max 5 lines):
- Top 2 contributors
- Key insight
- Score: A-F with one-word rationale
```

### Task 2: Commit Message Standards
```markdown
# Goal: Analyze commit message quality and standards compliance

Save your findings to: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-commit-messages.md

**Data Source:** Local git only

Analyze:
- Conventional commit format usage (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Subject line length compliance (50-72 chars)
- Body explanation for complex changes
- Issue/ticket references

Sample 50-100 commits across multiple authors.

**Output structure:**
```markdown
# Team Assessment: Commit Message Standards

## Convention Adoption
| Author | Conventional % | Quality |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| ... | X% | A-F |

## Message Quality Distribution
| Quality | Count | % |
|---------|-------|---|
| Excellent | N | X% |
| Good | N | X% |
| Acceptable | N | X% |
| Poor | N | X% |

## Common Issues
1. [Issue with 3 examples, "47 more similar"]
2. [Issue with 3 examples, "12 more similar"]

## Score: A-F (one line rationale)

- Bug fix patterns (quick fixes vs proper solutions)
- Technical debt introduction vs removal
- TODO/FIXME comment density

**Output structure:**
```markdown
# Team Assessment: Code Quality

**Data Source:** Local git + file discovery

Analyze:
- Test files and their authors (via git blame)
- Who writes tests vs who doesn't
- Coverage gaps in critical paths
- Test file to source file ratios

**Output structure:**
```markdown
# Team Assessment: Test Coverage

## Test Contribution by Author
| Author | Test Commits | Test Files | Lines Blamed | Score |
|--------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| ... | N | N | N (X%) | A-F |

```

Return summary (max 5 lines):
- Test authorship concentration
- Coverage gap
- Score: A-F with one-word rationale
```

### Task 5: AI Adoption Analysis
```markdown
# Goal: Assess AI tool adoption and usage patterns in the team

Save your findings to: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-ai-adoption.md

**Data Source:** Local git + code pattern analysis

**AI Usage Signals (in code patterns):**
- Consistent formatting across unrelated files (auto-format)
- Boilerplate with similar variable names (AI generation)
- Structured comments: `// TODO:`, `// Generated by`
- Rapid file creation: < 5 min between commits on same file
- Large PRs with uniform style (no organic variation)
- `[pi]` or `[ai]` markers in commit messages

Analyze:
- Code style consistency patterns
- Boilerplate frequency
- Formatting uniformity
- AI-related documentation/PRs

**Output structure:**
```markdown
# Team Assessment: AI Adoption

## AI Adoption by Author
| Author | AI Signals | Code Quality | Effectiveness |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| ... | Low/Med/High | A-F | A-F |

## Adoption Distribution

- Author attribution for doc work
- README updates, API docs, ADRs, runbooks
- Documentation coverage (what's documented vs not)

**Output structure:**
```markdown
# Team Assessment: Documentation

## Documentation Contributions
| Author | Doc Commits | Files Created | Files Updated |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| ... | N | N | N |

## Documentation Coverage
| Area | Documented | Last Updated |

2. [Finding with evidence] [confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Score: A-F (one line rationale)

## Recommendations

2. [Secondary]
```

Return summary (max 5 lines):
- Top incident responder
- Production ownership concentration
- Score: A-F with one-word rationale
```

### Task 8: Code Review Participation
```markdown
# Goal: Analyze code review participation and quality by developer

Save your findings to: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-code-review.md

**Data Source:** Local git + file discovery

**IMPORTANT:** Local git cannot verify PR reviews. Git history shows who merged, not who reviewed.
- To get review data: run `gh pr list --state merged` or `az repos pr list`
- If tools unavailable: score = D, note "Cannot verify peer review from local git"

Analyze:
- Merged PR commits (who merged, how many)
- Co-authored commits (indicate collaboration)
- Review participation rate (if verifiable)

**Output structure:**
```markdown
# Team Assessment: Code Review

## Review Participation (local git only)
| Author | Merges | Co-authored | Participation Rate | Score |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| ... | N | N | X% | A-F |

## Data Availability
- PR review data: **NOT available from local git** [confidence: LOW - requires API]
- Review approval data: **NOT available from local git** [confidence: LOW - requires API]

## Review Distribution
[Analysis of review load distribution]

## Key Findings
1. [Finding with evidence] [confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
2. [Finding with evidence] [confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Score: A-F (one line rationale)

## Recommendations
1. Run `gh pr list --state merged --limit 100` for full review data
2. [Priority]
```

Return summary (max 5 lines):
- Merge concentration
- Data limitation warning
- Score: A-F with one-word rationale
```

## Phase 3: Read Agent Outputs

After all 8 tasks complete, read each agent's output file:
```
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-commit-volume.md
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-commit-messages.md
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-code-quality.md
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-test-coverage.md
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-ai-adoption.md
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-documentation.md
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-incidents.md
read path: docs/assessment/team-<REPORT_PREFIX>-code-review.md
```

## Phase 4: Generate Final Report

Synthesize findings into the comprehensive report.
