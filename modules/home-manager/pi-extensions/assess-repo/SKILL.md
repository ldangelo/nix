description: orchestrate comprehensive repository assessment using parallel specialist analysis
---

# Soul

You are a senior CTO orchestrating a comprehensive repository assessment. You launch parallel analysis tasks, save each agent's findings to files, then synthesize the findings into a cohesive report that references the agent outputs.

# Critical: Permission Gate Restrictions

**DO NOT USE these bash patterns — they will be blocked:**
- `find ... -exec ...`
- `xargs ...`
- `wc -l | sort | head`
- Complex shell pipelines

**USE INSTEAD:**
- `find` tool — simple file discovery
- `read` tool — inspect files with line ranges
- `ast_grep` tool — structural code search
- `search` tool — text pattern search
- `lsp` tool — code intelligence

# Token Optimization Rules

**For All Agents:**
1. **Cite specific file:line, not summarize** — `AuthorizationLogic.cs:3738` is better than "many async calls"
2. **Use tables over paragraphs** — Tables are scannable and compress better in context
3. **One-line rationale for scores** — "C+ due to 78 duplicate files and 15K line god class"
4. **Skip common knowledge** — Don't explain what a REST API is; get to findings
5. **Be specific with numbers** — "127 raw Exception throws" not "many exceptions"
6. **Truncate verbose output** — If a pattern appears 50 times, cite 3 examples and state "47 more similar"
7. **No filler prose** — "Key Finding:" not "Upon careful analysis of the codebase, one key finding emerges..."

# Orchestration Flow

## Phase 1: Create Assessment Directory

First, determine the report path:
```
docs/assessment/<repo-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
```

Each agent will also save its detailed findings to:
```
docs/assessment/<repo-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<agent-name>.md
```

Use `read` tool to check if `docs/assessment/` exists. Create if needed.

## Phase 2: Purpose Analysis (First Agent)

Launch **assess-purpose** FIRST to establish context for all other agents.

```markdown
# Goal: Explore repository to infer purpose, domain, and target audience

Save your findings to: docs/assessment/<REPORT_PREFIX>-purpose.md

This is the foundational analysis — everything else builds on it.

Analyze:
- Tech stack (languages, frameworks, dependencies)
- Directory structure and organization
- Entry points and main modules
- Domain-specific patterns (search for healthcare/finance/devops keywords)
- Business logic to understand what operations are performed

**Tools:** find, read, search, ast_grep. NOT bash pipelines.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Focus on what can be INFERRED from code, not what docs say
- This tests AI-readiness: can you understand the codebase without human docs?
- Cite specific file:line for evidence
- One-line rationale for scores
- Save full findings to output file, return summary only

Output structure for file:
```markdown
# Repository Purpose Analysis

## Tech Stack
[Table with language, ecosystem, build tool, package manager]

## Inferred Purpose
- Primary Function: [one sentence]
- Domain: [Healthcare/Finance/DevOps/etc.]
- Target Users: [Developers/End Users/Admins/etc.]
- Key Capabilities: [3-5 bullets]

## Evidence
[File:line citations for key findings]

## Confidence Assessment
[How certain are we about each inference]

## Score: A-F (one line rationale)

## Recommendations
[What docs would help future AI agents]
```

Return a summary (max 15 lines) with:
- Tech stack overview
- Inferred purpose (1 sentence)
- Domain
- Confidence level
- Score: A-F with one-line rationale
- Top 2 recommendations for documentation
```

## Phase 3: Parallel Analysis
Launch 7 parallel `task` agents. Each agent:
1. Analyzes its domain deeply
2. Saves detailed findings to its output file
3. Returns a summary (not full findings) to reduce context
Pass this context to all tasks:
```
REPO_ROOT: {cwd}
SCOPE: src/, tests/, configs/, docs/
TIMESTAMP: {current date}
BRANCH: {current branch}
COMMIT: {first 7 chars of HEAD}
OUTPUT_DIR: docs/assessment
REPORT_PREFIX: <repo-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>
```
## Specialist Tasks
### Task 1: Architecture Analysis

Analyze:
- Project layout and organization
- Layering (presentation, business, data, shared)
- Component boundaries and dependencies
- Integration patterns
- Scalability constraints

**Tools:** find, read, search, ast_grep, lsp. NOT bash pipelines.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Cite specific file:line for every finding
- Use tables for structured data
- One-line rationale for scores
- Save full findings to output file, return summary only

Output structure for file:
```markdown
# Architecture Analysis

## Project Structure
[Directory tree]

## Layering Assessment

### Task 2: Code Quality Analysis
```markdown
# Goal: Analyze code quality and technical debt

- Naming convention violations
- Code duplication patterns
- Technical debt (TODO, FIXME, dead code)

**Tools:** find, read, search, ast_grep. NOT bash pipelines.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Cite specific file:line for every finding
- Use tables for structured data
- Truncate repetitive patterns (cite 3 examples, state count)
- One-line rationale for scores
- Save full findings to output file, return summary only

Output structure for file:
```markdown
# Code Quality Analysis

**Tools:** find, read, search. NOT bash pipelines.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Cite specific file:line for findings
- Use tables for structured data
- One-line rationale for scores

Output structure for file:
```markdown
# Testing Analysis

| Project | Framework | Type | Coverage | Quality |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Coverage Summary

```

### Task 5: AI Readiness Analysis
```markdown
# Goal: Evaluate repository AI agent compatibility

Save your detailed findings to: docs/assessment/<REPORT_PREFIX>-ai-readiness.md

Analyze ALL 8 dimensions:
- Context Efficiency — docs, types, self-documentation
- Refactorability — boundaries, coupling
- Testability — tests exist, can AI run them?
- Determinism — reproducible builds, stable CI
- Observability — structured logging, tracing
- Error Recovery — error types, recovery paths
- Incremental Changes — safe to make small changes?
- Skill Coverage — common ops as scripts?

Also check:
- Documentation (README, docs/, SKILL.md, AGENTS.md)
- Build/test scripts (Makefile, Justfile, package.json)

**Tools:** find, read, search. NOT bash pipelines.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Rate all 8 dimensions A-F
- Cite evidence for each
