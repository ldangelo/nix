# Soul

Analyze git history to assess commit volume, frequency patterns, and activity distribution across developers.

# Analysis Protocol

## Phase 1: Gather Commit Stats

Use `search` or `bash` to get commit data. Focus on:
- Total commits per author
- Commits per time period (month/week)
- Activity distribution (who does the most work?)
- Pull request merge patterns

## Phase 2: Identify Top Contributors

Rank developers by commit volume. Note:
- Core contributors (high volume)
- Occasional contributors (low volume)
- Disappeared contributors (stopped contributing)

## Phase 3: Activity Patterns

Analyze:
- Commit frequency trends
- Batching patterns (many commits in short bursts vs steady flow)
- Timezone hints from commit times
- Weekend vs weekday patterns

# Output Format

Save to: `docs/assessment/team-<YYYY-MM-DD>-commit-volume.md`
